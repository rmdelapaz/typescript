# React TypeScript Course Development - Progress Tracker

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: File System Location

**This project is located on the USER'S COMPUTER at:**

```
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\practicalace\projects\typescript
```

### 🚨 MANDATORY FILE SYSTEM RULES

Claude has access to TWO different file systems:
1. **User's Computer** - Paths with `\\wsl$\`, `D:\`, `G:\`, `/Users/`, or `/home/` prefixes
2. **Claude's Computer** - Paths like `/home/claude` or `/mnt/user-data`

**FOR THIS PROJECT:**
- ✅ **ALWAYS USE:** `Filesystem:write_file`, `Filesystem:read_text_file`, `Filesystem:list_directory`, `Filesystem:edit_file`
- ❌ **NEVER USE:** `create_file`, `bash_tool`, `str_replace`, `view` (these are for Claude's computer)

**If you see a path starting with `\\wsl$\` - STOP and use Filesystem tools!**

---

## 🚨 START EVERY SESSION WITH THIS CHECKLIST

Before doing ANY work, Claude must read this file and output:

```
✓ File system location: \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\practicalace\projects\typescript
✓ Tools to use: Filesystem:read_text_file, Filesystem:write_file, Filesystem:edit_file
✓ Current status: [Fill in from "Current Status" section]
✓ Next task: [Fill in from "Next Task" field]
```

**DO NOT PROCEED until this checklist is complete.**

---

## 🔔 TOKEN LIMIT WARNING REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL USER PREFERENCE:** Ray prefers to be warned when conversations approach token limits so he can start fresh chats rather than allowing automatic compaction to occur.

Claude MUST monitor context length and warn the user BEFORE reaching critical limits. Do not let automatic sub-compaction happen without warning.

- Other lessons: ⬜ Modules 1-4 remaining to evaluate

**IMPORTANT - Visualization Philosophy:**
The number of visualizations per lesson should be determined by educational value, NOT by hitting a target number. Each visualization should only be added if it:
1. Explains a concept that's difficult to convey through text/code alone
2. Provides interactive understanding that static diagrams can't achieve
3. Doesn't duplicate existing Mermaid diagrams or code examples without adding significant value
4. Addresses a common point of confusion for learners

Some lessons may need 1-2 visualizations, others may need 5-6, and some may need none. The "4 per lesson" pattern in early lessons was coincidental, not a mandate.

**Retrospective on Lesson 5.3:**
- Viz 1 (Refs vs Variables): HIGH value - makes persistence concept tangible
- Viz 2 (DOM Lifecycle): MODERATE value - lesson already had Mermaid diagram covering this; possibly redundant
- Viz 3 (Ref vs State Re-render): HIGH value - "stale" screen value demonstration is powerful
- Viz 4 (Focus Management): MODERATE-HIGH value - working demo adds value but concept is fairly intuitive
- Honest assessment: 2-3 visualizations may have been sufficient

**Visualizations in Lesson 5.1:**
1. ⚡ Interactive useReducer Cycle (Section 1) - Animated dispatch → reducer → state flow [EXISTING]
2. 🔄 Interactive Reducer Flow (Section 2) - Clickable step-by-step reducer pattern [EXISTING]
3. 📊 Interactive Complexity Comparison (Section 3) - useState vs useReducer complexity growth chart [NEW]

3. 🔍 Interactive useContext Flow (Section 5) - Animated trace showing how useContext finds the nearest Provider
4. 🔄 Interactive Context Re-render Visualizer (Section 10) - Watch components flash when context changes to understand performance implications

**Visualizations in Lesson 5.3:**
1. ⚡ Interactive Refs vs Variables (Section 2) - See how refs persist while variables reset on re-render
2. 🎬 Interactive DOM Ref Lifecycle (Section 3) - Animated timeline showing null → element → null lifecycle

4. 🎯 Interactive Focus Management Demo (Section 7) - Working form with programmatic focus control using refs

**Visualizations in Lesson 5.4:**
1. ⚖️ Interactive Memoization Cost/Benefit (Section 6) - Bar chart comparing scenarios from simple math to large arrays, showing when memoization helps vs hurts
   - HIGH VALUE: Addresses critical misconception that memoization is "free"
   - Shows 4 scenarios: Simple Math (hurts), Small Array (marginal), Medium Array (helps), Large Array (essential)
   - Lesson already well-served by existing Mermaid diagrams and code examples for other concepts

**Module 10 Complete!** All lessons in Module 10 have been evaluated.

**Evaluation Summary for Module 10:**
- Lesson 10.1 (Performance Optimization): 1 visualization added (Re-render Cascade)
- Lesson 10.2 (TypeScript Advanced Patterns): 0 visualizations needed (compile-time concepts)

- This is guidance/reference content—course recap, technology overview, career advice
- Already has 4+ Mermaid diagrams (Course Journey path, Next.js Decision Tree, Career Mindmap, Skills Overview)
- Topics covered are external technologies (Next.js, Server Components, animation libraries) best learned by building with them
- Component library comparisons are effectively presented in tables
- Career guidance and portfolio advice are actionable text content, not behavioral concepts
- The "visualization" for these topics IS building projects with the actual technologies
- No invisible runtime behavior to reveal—this is about "what to learn next" not "how something works"
- Similar to course conclusion content—celebratory and forward-looking, not instructional

**Visualizations in Lesson 10.4:**
- ✅ EVALUATED - 0 visualizations needed
- Deployment is fundamentally about external platform interactions, not internal React app behavior

- Similar to Lesson 9.5 (Testing)—external tools provide better visualization than any SVG we could create

**Visualizations in Lesson 10.2:**
- ✅ EVALUATED - 0 visualizations needed
- TypeScript advanced patterns operate entirely at compile time, not runtime
- Already has 2 Mermaid diagrams (Generics flow, Utility Types relationships)
- 30+ comprehensive code examples demonstrating each pattern with actual usage

- 3 comprehensive exercises provide hands-on practice for building understanding
- Topics (generics, discriminated unions, type guards, utility types, conditional types, template literals) are conceptual patterns learned through coding practice

  - Stats panel: Total Renders, Renders Saved, Efficiency percentage
  - Dynamic explanation panel changes based on memo state
  - Makes invisible re-render behavior tangible and immediate
  - Directly demonstrates the core value proposition of React.memo
  - Lesson already has 7 Mermaid diagrams for conceptual coverage; this adds runtime behavior visualization

**Visualizations in Lesson 8.4:**

  - Animated timeline showing fresh → stale → garbage collected transitions
  - Adjustable staleTime and gcTime sliders to experiment with different configurations

  - Event log showing exactly what happens when: fresh (no refetch), stale (return + background refetch), GC (loading + fetch)
  - Refetch counter tracks background refetches triggered
  - Makes the invisible timing relationship between staleTime and gcTime tangible
  - Critical concept - this timing confusion is a common source of bugs and misunderstandings
- Other topics (queries, mutations, optimistic updates, query keys) are well-served by:
  - 7 existing Mermaid diagrams covering state machines and flows
  - Extensive code examples and patterns
  - Hands-on exercises for building

- TypeScript type inference is a compile-time feature that can't be visualized at runtime
- Existing Mermaid diagram adequately covers the Zod → React Hook Form workflow
- Extensive code examples and comparison tables serve this topic better than interactive visualizations
- Adding visualizations would feel forced without adding pedagogical value

**Visualizations in Lesson 7.2:**
1. ⚡ Interactive Re-render Comparison (Section 1) - Side-by-side comparison showing how controlled forms re-render ALL fields on every keystroke while uncontrolled (React Hook Form) forms have zero re-renders

## Tool Selection Strategy

### Filesystem:edit_file vs Filesystem:write_file

| Use `edit_file` when: | Use `write_file` when: |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| User says "edit", "update", "fix", "change" | User says "create", "write", "make new" |
| Making targeted changes | Creating brand new files |
| Updating specific sections | Complete rewrites |

**Default to `edit_file` for updates** unless rewriting is more efficient.
